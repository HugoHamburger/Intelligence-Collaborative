Github done for the purpose of the ICO module at the Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille.

We divided our work on two case studies for the VRPTW problem. 

You can see both cases here with associated files (especially three agents : genetic, tabou and simulated annealing).

You can also find Kaggle notebooks with the following links :
- Reinforcement learning on genetic agent : https://www.kaggle.com/ascagne/rl-gen/edit
- Reinforcement learning on tabou agent : https://www.kaggle.com/ascagne/rl-tabouv2/edit
- Reinforcement learning on simulated annealing agent : https://www.kaggle.com/ascagne/rl-rs/edit
